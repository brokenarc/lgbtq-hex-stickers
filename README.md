![banner image with several pride hexagons](./static/header-image.png "Pride hexagon banner")

This repository contains a collection of over 30 hexagonal stickers representing various LGBTQ+ Pride flags.

The hexagons have the following characteristics:

- designed for Sticker Mule&rsquo;s [2.17&rdquo; &times; 2.5&rdquo; hexagon sticker template](https://www.stickermule.com/uses/hexagon-stickers)
- no visible graphic content outside the cut line
- a white border that extends &frac18;&rdquo; inside the cut line
- a 1 point grey line around the inside of the white boarder

Image assets from the [lgbtq-flag-stickers](https://github.com/brokenarc/lgbtq-flag-stickers) repository were used to create these stickers.

## Asset Files

### Adobe Illustrator source files

The Illustrator files have been assembled for printing as stickers. Each file has the following characteristics:

- CMYK color space
- artboards measure 2&frac34;&rdquo; (69.85 mm) square
- minimum &frac18;&rdquo; (3.176 mm) gap between artboard edge and hexagon points
- stripes and bars on flag graphics overlap (reduces export artifacts)

### Screen image files

Screen display versions are provided in scalable (SVG) and bitmap (PNG) formats. The PNG files are 1,024 pixels high and have transparent backgrounds.

### Template

The blank template used to create the hexagons is located at the top level of the project as the file `hexagon-sticker-2_5-inch.ait`. A cut line path is provided on its own layer to support making stickers with no inside border.
